Here you'll name your Virtual Machine, select where to save it, and also select your ISO image, Type, Subtype, and Version.

You can check "Skip unattended install"

For this lab I simply named the VM "Ubuntu" but you can name it whatever you'd like. :

Next you will select how much RAM you want to give to your VM. Make sure to be aware of how much memory your computer has to spare.

If you aren't sure you can simply leave it as is. :

Next select how much storage you want to give to your VM then hit "Finish". Again, be aware of how much memory your computer has.

Awesome! Now that the Machine is created, you can power it on. :

Next you'll create an account to login to your Linux VM. Normally you would not uncheck "Require ny password at login" but we will leave it unchecked since this is a lab environment.

Wait for the install to complete. This may take a while. :

Once the install has completed select "Restart now" :

Great! You have completed this lab! Now you can play around with a Linux operating system however you'd like and become more familiar if you aren't already.
